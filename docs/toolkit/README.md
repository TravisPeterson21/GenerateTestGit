# Define Goals for Integration

In Step 1, state education agency (SEA) project teams will articulate the need for the IDEA Part B data integration project and set corresponding goals, evaluate existing data integration processes, define the scope of the project, and begin documenting the data systems that will be affected. These tasks create a shared vision for data integration within the SEA and help identify necessary resources.

## Why complete step 1?

Developing a common understanding of the project and articulating what it will and will not accomplish helps create buy-in and set expectations. The documents created in this step (e.g., the use case, self-assessment, data system architecture, and scope document) serve as planning and communication tools that can be used to promote the project within the SEA, onboard new staff, set boundaries, and answer questions that arise.

## Process and Timing

Tasks in Step 1 of the toolkit can be completed in a two-day meeting or across a series of shorter in-person or virtual meetings. Each task will take 1 to 3 hours to complete. However, the tasks contain several interdependent activities, so project teams should review each document to ensure coherence with those completed previously. Following initial meetings to draft the documents, each team member should review them to confirm agreement or offer feedback before presenting them to SEA leadership. The project team should update these materials as needed based on feedback from leadership or changes in the scope of the project. The data integration self-assessment can also be repeated after the project is complete to show progress and identify ongoing needs.

The use case describes the goal of data integration. It articulates the impact and benefits in general terms and creates a common understanding of the problem or need that data integration will address. Clearly identifying the goals for data integration can help build support within your SEA for the integration effort.
