# Install Generate, create and perform extract, transform, and load (ETL) procedures

## **Install Generate, create and perform extract, transform, and load (ETL) procedures**

In Step 4, the project team will integrate the data identified and aligned in previous steps by extracting the data from the source systems, transforming it from SEA defined elements into the Common Education Data Standards (CEDS) elements and loading the data into CEDS database structures after installing the Generate software. They will also validate the procedures and resulting data by matching it with data prepared through the SEA’s legacy process. Upon completing Step 4, the project team will have installed Generate, completed the ETL, and validated the data so it is ready for ED_Facts_ reporting.

Step 4 involves creating the ETL code and executing the movement of data from source systems into the CEDS data structures

## **Process and Timing**&#x20;

The tasks in Step 4 include installing Generate, building the ETLs, and reviewing data quality after the data are transformed and migrated into Generate. Planning for the location and installation of Generate will have been begun in _Step 1.2.2 Document Data System Architecture_[_**1**_](https://ciidta.communities.ed.gov/#superscript%20#1).&#x20;

The effort involved in building ETLs and reviewing data depends on how many ED_Facts_ files are in scope for this project and the availability of ETL developer resources. As the team gains familiarity with the process and related documents, the step will become less burdensome. &#x20;

For each ETL checklist, allow a few weeks to build the ETL–depending on how much time each team member can dedicate to this work or if you are receiving intensive technical assistance from CIID. ETL developers who are familiar with the CEDS physical data structure will also improve the speed at which the ETL is developed. &#x20;

The process in Step 4, except for installing Generate, will be repeated for each ETL in scope of the SEA’s project.

1Project teams using CIID Intensive Technical assistance will work with CIID developers to confirm installation plans and finalize details.
