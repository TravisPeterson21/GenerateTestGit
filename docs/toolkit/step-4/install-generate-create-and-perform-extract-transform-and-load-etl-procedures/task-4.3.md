# Task 4.3

## **Overall Description of the Task**

An after-action review is an assessment of the project team’s performance on one set of ETL development and file submission. It will support organizational learning and improvement. This task is composed of an assessment of the project or a component of the project and a meeting to discuss the results of the assessment. Suggestions for future improvements in the processes and documentation are recorded, and the project team will adjust future ETL development and file reviews based on this feedback.

## **Activities**

### **4.3.1 Conduct after-action meeting**

The project team will meet to discuss their responses to several simple questions to assess the process used for the Generate project. An after-action meeting should occur at the completion of each successful ED_Facts_ report that is validated and then repeated for each data domain along the way or done only once at the completion of all ED_Facts_ reports or data domains. Each person on the project team should take turns responding to the after-action questions in the After Action Review Agenda. One person in the meeting should record the responses. After all project team members have provided their feedback to each question, the group will discuss ways to modify the process.

### **4.3.2 Evaluate action and apply lessons learned for future projects**

Following the after-action meeting, the project lead will consolidate the resulting after-action ideas. The project lead should review the project documentation for opportunities to modify future processes or record changes to the project plan in response to suggested ideas. The complete list of ideas/results from the after-action meeting should be available to all project team members to consult during the next phase of the project and remind the team of any modifications. At each subsequent after-action meeting, the list of prior after-action ideas should be reviewed, and the project team should decide if the change worked, didn’t work, should be continued, or should be discarded. The project lead or notetaker will update the after-action meeting notes and project plan and save them in a location where all project team members can reference them.
