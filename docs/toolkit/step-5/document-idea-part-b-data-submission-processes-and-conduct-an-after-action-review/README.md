# Document IDEA Part B Data Submission Processes and Conduct an After-Action Review

In Step 5, teams will use the IDEA Part B Data Submission Organizer to document processes for completing IDEA Part B data submissions and establish plans for routinely revisiting and updating the organizer. Teams will also complete a full-project after-action review to evaluate integration efforts and apply lessons learned for future integration efforts

## **Why complete step 5?**&#x20;

Completing the _IDEA Part B Data Submission Organizer_ provides the team and stakeholders with a comprehensive picture of the different action items, timelines, staff, and data systems necessary to finalize and submit each of the data files. Communicating and obtaining approval of this documentation from relevant staff and/or agency leadership ensures all parties are aware of and agree with the data submission activities. This documentation can guide project planning, including allocation of staff and resources, to ensure data are on track to be submitted in a timely fashion. Conducting an after-action review allows teams to reflect on integration efforts, identify areas of concern moving forward, and develop a plan to improve processes and promote sustainability.

## **Process and Timing**&#x20;

SEAs may complete Step 5 in a three-day meeting or as a series of shorter in-person or virtual meetings. Each data submission tab of the _IDEA Part B Data Submission Organizer_ will take 2-3 hours to complete. Obtaining approval for the action items documented in each tab of the organizer may vary based on the data collection, the number of staff involved, and the data systems used. The after-action review may be more time intensive, requiring planning on the front end to compile documentation of the integration efforts.&#x20;

Tabs of the organizer should be reviewed and updated periodically (e.g., annually) to reflect any adjustments to action items, timelines, staffing, and data systems for each data submission. Key findings or lessons learned from the after-action review should be addressed in the overall project plan and routinely revisited and updated as needed throughout the data integration project.
