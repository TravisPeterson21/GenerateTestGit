# Task 5.1

## **Overall Description of the Task**

Successful, sustained implementation of the data integration project requires an in-depth understanding of all the work that must be completed prior to submitting IDEA Part B data files. Maintaining and updating documentation of these steps provides the team and stakeholders with a shared understanding this work. It also helps the team manage project timelines and workflow.

## **Activities**

### **5.1.1 Complete the **_**IDEA Part B Data Submission Organizer**_

This organizer helps project teams keep track of data elements, action items, deadlines, and team member responsibilities for submitting IDEA Part B ED_Facts_ files. The organizer provides a yearly calendar to benchmark annual events as well as a separate worksheet for each IDEA Part B data submission. Several sections of the organizer are based on documentation originally completed in the Project Planner The tabs in the organizer include:

* Calendar – provides a monthly view of the IDEA data tasks and when submissions are due, with flexibility for SEAs to add their own internal tasks, SEA reports, and/or due dates)
* Child Count
* Maintenance of Effort (MOE) Reduction and Coordinated Early Intervening Services (CEIS) – tab included for convenience, not an ED_Facts_ Submission System submission
* Dispute Resolution – tab included for convenience, not an ED_Facts_ Submission System submission
* Personnel
* Exiting
* Discipline
* Assessment
* Data Stewards and Sources – this information is already captured in the Data Integration Project Planner and content can be copied and pasted into this tab

### **5.1.2 Obtain approval of IDEA Part B data submission documentation**

Prior to finalizing the documentation compiled for each data submission, the team should solicit feedback and obtain final approval of information documented in the _IDEA Part B Data Submission Organizer_. The following staff should review the documentation prior to approval:

* IDEA Part B Data Manager
* ED_Facts_ Coordinators
* Staff on the data governance team
* Team members who are responsible for the data submissions (team members may vary based on the IDEA Part B data submission)
* Staff who are documented in the organizer as lead or support staff; and
* Staff who are integrally involved with the data systems linked to action items (e.g., IT staff).

Once feedback has been provided and incorporated, SEAs should submit the final draft of the organizer to agency leadership for approval. After approval is obtained, the final version of the organizer should be disseminated to the team and all relevant parties within the SEA.

### **5.1.3 Develop process for updating the **_**IDEA Part B Data Submission Organizer**_

Changes in data submission requirements, SEA data systems, and SEA staffing can affect the processes outlined in the organizer. It is important for teams to establish timelines for revisiting the organizer (recommend at least annually) to update documentation, as needed, for project sustainability. When reviewing and updating the organizer, teams should:

* Include staff responsible for data collection and submissions who will have the most in-depth knowledge of the work and any changes to processes.
* Review file specifications for all IDEA Part B data submissions to identify any changes or new components.
* Include data governance staff to get input and/or approval of revisions to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the changes.
* Update the organizer well in advance of the file submissions to have time to make appropriate changes/adjustments.
