# Task 5.2

## **Overall Description of the Task**

An after-action review is an assessment of the project teamâ€™s performance, looking at successes and failures to support organizational learning and improvement. This task is composed of a meeting to evaluate the project (or a component of the project), and a follow-up meeting.  Suggestions for future improvements in the processes and documentation are recorded, and the project team adjusts future activities based on this feedback.

## **Activities**

### **5.2.1 Conduct after-action meeting**

The project team will meet to discuss their responses to several simple questions that assess the process used for the integration project. An after-action meeting can occur at the completion of each successful, validated ED_Facts_ submission (then repeated for each subsequent IDEA Part B data submission) or once after the completion of all ED_Facts_ submissions. Each person on the project should take turns responding to the after-action questions in the After-Action Review Tool. One person in the meeting will record the responses. After all project team members have provided their feedback to that question, the group should discuss process modifications and document these suggestions.

### **5.2.2 Evaluate action and apply lessons learned for future projects**

Teams will use the information documented in the after-action meeting to determine next steps. As a result of this review, there may be adjustments to timelines, processes, roles and responsibilities, and the project plan for the current integration efforts and future work. Adjustments should be clearly documented and articulated to both the project team and agency leaders. The lessons learned, which should be captured in the after-action meeting documentation, will assist in future integrations and assist staff members who may not have been involved in previous efforts.
