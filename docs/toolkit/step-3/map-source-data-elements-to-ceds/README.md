# Map Source Data Elements to CEDS

In Step 3, SEA project teams will locate and document the source elements and associated metadata required by ED_Facts_ and align each element with the CEDS standard, resolving discrepancies as a team. This is the first step towards writing the extract, transform and load (ETL) code that moves data into the CEDS data warehouse. &#x20;

## **Why complete Step 3**

CEDS is an accessible, searchable, and centralized location for metadata. Aligning source data to CEDS allows SEA staff and stakeholders to improve their understanding of SEA data and to share metadata. The resulting documentation of business rules can be used internally (e.g., to train new staff) and publicly (i.e., published CEDS maps) to communicate how source data maps to CEDS.&#x20;

Aligning source elements to CEDS is important because it describes how source data should be transformed to create accurate files for ED_Facts_ reporting.  Aligning source elements to CEDS is the first step in translating source data to a common language and creates an understanding of how the SEA’s data relates to the standard. Sharing Align maps and viewing other states’ maps can help identify commonalities and encourage partnerships or information sharing. &#x20;

## **Process and Timing**&#x20;

Tasks in Step 3 of the toolkit are iterative and may be repeated over a period of weeks or months depending whether the project team maps all the source data collections at once or maps data sets individually in preparation for specific ED_Facts_ due dates.  Mapping one data set may take a Subject Matter Expert (SME) several hours. Tasks include preparing the documentation and aligning elements to CEDS. Following initial mapping, the SME and technical staff with knowledge of the intended use of the data elements within the data system should meet to review the alignments and reconcile any gaps or discrepancies.

| <ul><li>If using CEDS Align for your data dictionary, create an Align map for each source system involved in the data integration effort. For example, Directory data required for ED<em>Facts</em> file FS029 may be in an organization management system while special education data may come from a statewide IEP system. Each system should have a separate Align map in CEDS.</li><li>For maintenance of sources to CEDS alignments in future years, the team may find it easiest to download the Align map, make any additional changes for the new school year, then upload it to the Align tool as a new map.</li></ul> |
