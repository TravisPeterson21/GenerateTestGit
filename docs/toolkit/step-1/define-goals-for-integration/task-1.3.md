# Task 1.3

## **Overall Description of the Task**

The activities in Task 1.3 are to confirm the scope of work on the data integration project and secure SEA resources needed for that work. The scope document for the data integration project takes the goals and questions presented in the use case, frames them within the current SEA environment, and further defines the work of the project. It also defines the limits of the project. The scope document supports a common understanding of the project parameters and expectations, and serves as a management tool to ensure goals are met.

This task also sets the stage for acquiring necessary resources, obtaining approvals, and preparing to begin work. It can serve as the foundation for the project management plan, resource allocation, budgeting, and prioritization of the work.

## **Activities**

### **1.3.1. Define the scope of the data integration project.**

Based on the goals of integration and use case identified in Step 1.1, develop a scope document that defines the extent and limits of the project and can guide the project’s evaluation by offering a set of objectives against which the project can be measured

The CIID Data Integration & Technical Assistance Scope Tool is a resource SEAs can use to document project scope and includes sections for defining:

* IDEA Part B ED_Facts_ files to be submitted through Generate;
* objectives and projected timelines to submit ED_Facts_ files through Generate;
* takeaways from the CIID IDEA Part B Data Framework Self-Assessment and data systems architecture activities;
* resources that will be provided by the SEA and CIID; and
* scope exclusions.

Document decisions about the scope and the reasoning behind those decisions so if the composition of the project team changes, the same issues will not need to be revisited.

For scope exclusions, identify what is outside of the bounds of the project. Exclusions may refer to data or reporting needs that will not be addressed by the integration project. Develop a “parking lot” of issues that are out of scope. The “parking lot” may also capture ideas for future enhancements, or additions to the data integration project for consideration in a future phase.

### **1.3.2 Secure SEA approval for integration project**

Set a meeting with SEA leadership and follow SEA protocols for confirming access to resources. At a minimum, secure approval from the Chief Information Officer or Technology Leaders, ED_Facts_ Coordinator, and the Director of Special Education.

Items to discuss:

* Use case and scope
* Staff availability and allocation of staff time
* Necessary costs associated with this project

Transparency and clarity around the amount of work needed to complete the integration project and the estimated length of time required will ensure ongoing support from leadership and help to avoid misunderstandings.
