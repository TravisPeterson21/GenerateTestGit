# Task 1.2

## **Overall Description of the Task**

The activities in Task 1.2 are to complete a data integration assessment and document the data system architecture. These exercises help project teams develop a common understanding of the SEA’s data system, processes, and needs. This task sets the stage for a clear scope of work; approvals and resources needed; and arrangements to begin work.

Discoveries or decisions made during these activities may prompt you to revise the use case, and you may choose to complete the activities in a different order depending on the situation in your SEA.

## **Activities**

### **1.2.1 Assess the current data integration environment**

The _CIID IDEA Part B Data Framework Self-Assessment_ is an Excel worksheet in which SEA staff can assess the current environment to support data integration, including tabs for:

* data governance policies and procedures;
* communication processes;
* current alignment of data to be integrated; and
* staff resources available to support data integration.&#x20;

We recommend that SEAs complete the self-assessment after at least one draft of the use case has been reviewed by stakeholders, since the two activities are closely related.

Completing the self-assessment and discussing each indicator allows project teams to document their current data governance policies and progress toward integration. Through that activity, teams may identify areas of strength and areas where they may need to focus extra attention to build a firm data governance structure

Weaknesses identified in the self-assessment may be added to the scope document. For example, the data sources that are undocumented or duplicative could be resolved as part of the data integration project.

### **1.2.2 Document data system architecture**

This activity involves creating a diagram of the SEA’s data system architecture to show data sources and their interconnections. The diagram will help ensure that all members of the project team understand the structure of the data system, define the data integration project, and identify components of the data system that may need adjustment. An example of a data system architecture diagram is provided below

As the team develops the diagram of their data system architecture, here are some questions and considerations:

* What are the sources for the IDEA ED_Facts_ files and where are they stored?
* Are there any impediments to accessing unit-level (i.e., student, staff) data?
* How and when does the SEA currently collect, verify, aggregate, and report ED_Facts_ data?
* Are there plans underway for system modernization? If so, consider creating a diagram for the current system and future system.

As the team maps out the diagram, consider the following:

* Are there any trouble spots in the system?
* What are points of risk for data quality?
* Are there areas where data are duplicated?
* What parts of the system may be affected by the data integration project?
* What changes will need to wait until the integration project is complete?

This diagram is useful as a reference throughout the data integration project, and as a communication aid with stakeholders within the department and with department leadership.
