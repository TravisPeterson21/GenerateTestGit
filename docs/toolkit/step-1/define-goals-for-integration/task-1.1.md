# Task 1.1

## **Activities**

### **1.1.1 Complete **_**Use Case Template**_

Developing the use case and the expected outcomes of data integration will:

* improve support for the project by demonstrating the benefits of data integration to critical stakeholders within the SEA;
* establish the general scope for the project and inform the development of an integration plan; and
* provide the project team with an initial list of stakeholders to support the projects

Short use case documents can be beneficial for creating buy-in with particular groups of stakeholders, and for routine department tasks like onboarding new staff.

The Use Case Template can be used to guide a core group of associated staff to:

* establish data integration needs;
* determine which data will be required;
* identify stakeholders, their data access and the ways the project will impact their work; and
* document timing and risks.

The resulting use case demonstrates the impact that integration will have at a high-level and assists with building support within the SEA.

### **1.1.2. Present draft use case to stakeholders and modify as necessary**

Once you have a draft use case, the next activity is presenting it to stakeholders within the SEA and finally to SEA leadership for approval. Presenting the draft use case to a broad coalition of people can help to create momentum, secure cooperation, and build the vision required to move forward.

Stakeholders in the SEA may include:

* Special Education Director
* Part B Data Manager
* ED_Facts_ Coordinator
* SLDS Staff
* Data Governance Coordinator
* Information Technology (IT) Staff
* Data Stewards or Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)

Once stakeholders are identified, schedule one or more in-person meetings to present and explain the goals and expected benefits of data integration. If in-person meetings are not feasible, accomplish this less formally through an email solicitation and document review process. Revise the use case based on feedback from the stakeholders and share revisions with stakeholders for approval before presenting it to SEA leadership. The result should be a common understanding and support from stakeholders and leadership.

Once your draft is final, schedule time with SEA leadership to present and explain the use case, gain support and, if required, formal approval to proceed with data integration efforts. Leadership support is often necessary to make staff available for the project as tasks proceed. If possible, include informed advocates and stakeholders in the meeting and have them explain their need for the data integration project. Their involvement is most effective when leadership views them as an important voice. Revise the draft use case based on feedback received from SEA leadership and share revisions with stakeholders for approval before sharing with leadership for final approval, if necessary.

As the data integration project progresses, keep SEA leadership apprised of progress to maintain awareness of the project’s value. If leadership changes, present the use case to the new leaders to inform them of the project’s purpose, answer questions, learn their priorities, and garner support.

**Toolkit Tip**

While completing the use case, project teams will discuss the same group of stakeholders and some of the same issues that will be handled more specifically in the Communication Plan tab of the Data Integration Project Planner (see Step 2).
