# Task 2.2

## üìÑ**Description of the Task**

Timely communication with stakeholders ensures all relevant parties are aware of the data integration work and the progress toward implementation. A strong communication plan informs and engages stakeholders throughout the integration effort and establishes decision-making processes for the SEA. A communication plan may also increase awareness of the project timeline and create an accountability structure for the project team.

## **‚úçÔ∏èActivities**

### **‚úÖ2.2.1 Develop a plan for communication with project team and stakeholders**

SEAs can use the **Communication Plan** tab in the **Data Integration Project Planner** to facilitate discussions and document to following decisions:

For each step, define its length, requirements to complete the step (what must be prepared or completed prior), and outcome. Identify start and end dates for each step keeping in mind the calendar information gathered in Task 1.3.4. In addition, identify a project team member responsible for each major step. This team member will serve as the individual responsible for developing a plan for the step, managing its implementation, and reporting on its progress to the project team.

Finalize a single document containing the project plan, timeline and team member assignments.

* Which internal and external stakeholders should receive communication about the integration efforts, who are the stakeholder points of contact, and what communication method will be used?
* What internal modes of communication will be used by the project team, including recurring meetings?
* What project documents are available or need to be developed, including details about the purpose of the documents, when they will be developed, and the project team members responsible?
* How will the project team keep SEA leadership updated on the integration work, including the content, frequency, and mode of communication?
* How will the project team differentiate among stakeholder groups in the levels of engagement and different modes of communication? For instance, SEA leadership may need only a brief overview of progress, while data stewards may need more frequent and in-depth updates.
* When and how will TA centers be involved in integration efforts?

In the **Communication Plan** tab, SEAs can document:

* stakeholder names, roles, contact information, and the type of communication they will receive;
* regularly scheduled project meetings, including the type of meeting, the frequency, staff leading the meeting, participants, and meeting location;
* a running list of project documents, including document names, descriptions, owners, and document distribution lists; and
* other communication vehicles, including communication methods, frequency, owners, and document distribution lists.

When creating their communication plan, project teams will determine who will be responsible for managing, updating, and distributing the plan. Having a dedicated team member, often the Project Manager, oversee communication can keep the work on track. Routinely reviewing the communication plan and making updates, as necessary, is essential to keeping internal and external stakeholders well-informed.
