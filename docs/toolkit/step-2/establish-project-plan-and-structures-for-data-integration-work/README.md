# Establish Project Plan and Structures for Data Integration Work

In Step 2, project teams will use the Data Integration Project Planner to document (1) the project team membership, roles, and responsibilities; (2) a communication plan; (3) a calendar of key dates for each IDEA Part B data collection; and (4) a project plan for data integration work.

## **Why complete step 2?**&#x20;

Reviewing key responsibilities, dates, and tasks, as well as drafting comprehensive documentation at the beginning of a project can help reduce risks and promote success. A project-specific communication plan can help keep relevant stakeholders up-to-date on the project team’s progress, ensure that key resources are available, and promote the project’s visibility with State Education Agency (SEA) leadership. A calendar and project plan set benchmarks for completing the work and inform allocation of personnel resources at specific times.&#x20;

## **Process and Timing**&#x20;

SEAs may complete step 2 of the toolkit in a two-day meeting or across a series of shorter in-person or virtual meetings. Each tab of the _Data Integration Project Planner_ will take 1 to 2 hours when completed in a group. &#x20;

Following initial writing sessions, each project team member should review the document and confirm agreement or offer feedback. The team should update the project plan and supporting documents periodically (e.g., quarterly) throughout the life of the data integration project. Plans can also be adapted if SEAs expand or contract their integration work, team membership changes, or additional members are added (including technical assistance \[TA] providers or vendors). At a minimum, calendars will need to be updated annually to account for changes in due dates for IDEA files.&#x20;
