description: Create IDEA Part B Data Calendar

# Task 2.3

## üìÑ**Description of the Task**

Prior to developing a project plan (see Task 2.4), project teams should create a calendar of key dates for IDEA data collections to ensure that work will align with internal and external deadlines and that team members are aware of them. SEAs can use the **Calendar tab** in the **Data Integration Project Planner** to document key dates and deadlines.

## **‚úçÔ∏èActivities**

### ‚úÖ2.3.1 Record key dates in an IDEA Part B data collection calendar

A calendar for IDEA data collections is not only important for current members of the project but also new team members if there is turnover on the project. When creating this documentation, the team should determine how they will maintain the calendar so changes initiated by the SEA or the federal government are reflected. The calendar should include not only the ED_Facts_ and SPP/APR due dates but also tasks or deadlines needed to maintain legacy data systems while integration work is being done.

While developing the calendar, keep the following questions in mind:

* Have all parties involved with IDEA data collections contributed to or approved the calendar, including SEA staff outside of the project team and in other program areas across the SEA?
* Has the project team consulted documentation, such as ED_Facts_ file specifications for the IDEA data collections, to confirm due dates and any changes to the collections?
* Does the calendar incorporate all the important dates for IDEA data collections, not just the dates or months when files are due? For example, consider including data quality review processes for each collection and when SEAs can resubmit IDEA data collections and data notes.
* Has the project team adopted plans to update the calendar so it remains current and reflects changes in systems, programs, or timelines?
* When is each type of data ready for analysis, review, verification, and submission?

| In Step 5 of the Toolkit, we will introduce The _Data Collection Organizer,_ a resource SEAs can use to document brief, step-by-step information on how they plan for, collect, verify, and maintain each IDEA data collection. The calendar that project teams create in Step 2 will serve as a base for documenting steps for submitting IDEA Part B data files. |
