# Task 2.4

## **Overall Description of the Task**

After documenting roles and responsibilities, developing a communication plan, and creating an IDEA Part B data collection calendar, the project team should establish management structures and processes for the data integration project.

## **Activities**

### **2.4.1 Develop a plan for managing the data integration project**

Define the project management needs and capabilities to be supported by the repository system. Project needs include:

* developing agendas and facilitating scheduled regular project team meetings;
* taking and distributing notes from project team meetings;
* collecting regular status updates from the project team;
* developing and maintaining a system for tracking data integration progress;
* maintaining and updating the project plan; and
* elevating relevant issues and decisions to SEA leadership.&#x20;

#### **Create a Resource Repository**

Project teams should also establish a resource repository (e.g., SharePoint site, Teams channel, network directory) and assign someone to maintain it. This repository should be accessible to all members of the project team and used to store relevant files, including project planning documents, meeting notes, data systems documentation, and technical documentation.

When creating the repository, consider solutions that may already be available and familiar to the project team members and the toolâ€™s usability, flexibility, and support of system users.

#### **Develop a Project Plan**

Develop a project plan that lists activities in the data integration effort, a timeline for each activity, and the specific individuals responsible. The project plan can be reviewed in project meetings to document what tasks have been completed and what needs to be done to meet deadlines. While SEAs may elect to use diverse project management tools/software to map out data integration work in greater detail, the Project Plan template provides the broad activities that must be completed to fully integrate your data. These activities might include for example:&#x20;

* creating CEDS alignment maps;
* developing ETL documentation;
* loading the data in both development and production environments;
* reviewing and validating data submission files; and
* submitting data submission files in the EDFacts Submission System.

Using the Roles and Responsibilities resource, SEAs should identify which members of the project team are responsible for these activities and who will be responsible for maintaining, updating, and communicating the project plan. If contracted consultants or vendors are part of the team, the SEA should incorporate key dates and activities related to the contracts for these consultants or vendors within the project plan.
