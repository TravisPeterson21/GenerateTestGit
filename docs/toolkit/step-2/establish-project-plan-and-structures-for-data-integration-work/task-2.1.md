# Task 2.1

## üìÑ**Description of the Task**

The first step in executing a successful data integration project is identifying key project team members and making sure everyone is clear on their assigned responsibilities. Clear lines of authority and task assignments prevent duplicating efforts or dropping work.

## **‚úçÔ∏èActivities**

### **‚úÖ2.1.1 Identify the project manager.**

The **Roles and Responsibilities** tab in the **Data Integration Project Planner** helps project teams document who will be responsible for each activity or work stream. As your team assigns staff roles and responsibilities, consider the following:

* Who has authority to make project decisions and lead the project team?
* Do members of the project team collectively understand the SEA‚Äôs data integration plan, current data systems, data governance processes, and have experience managing data coordination projects?
* Does the project team have representatives from different offices and stakeholder groups within the SEA?
* Is there a back-up assigned for each role to mitigate risk in case of turnover or extended absences?
* When will the project team meet for updates on data integration activities and to make project decisions?
* How will subject matter experts (SMEs) and data stewards within the SEA be kept aware of the project work and their role in reviewing data mapping; **Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) Checklists**; business rules; and data verification?
* What role will consultants or vendors hired by the SEA to complete the data integration work play and how will the roles be documented in the **Roles and Responsibilities** tab?
* How can the project team maximize efficiency by convening subgroups of the team to accomplish specific objectives that don‚Äôt require the whole team?

In the **Roles and Responsibilities** tab, SEAs can document staff responsible for:

* project management and coordination;
* Common Education Data Standards (see Step 3);
* ETL Checklist (see Step 4);
* ED_Facts_ and reporting;
* Generate release and servers; and
* subject matter expertise.&#x20;

### **‚úÖ2.1.2 Document data stewards and sources**

The **Data Stewards and Sources** tab in the **Data Integration Project Planner** helps project teams document the data steward and data source for each data collection. For each ED_Facts_ file, this tab contains the yearly due date, file numbers and titles, content area, data stewards, and local data sources. For each file, record the name and position for each data steward, and the location of the local data source.

This tab serves as a quick reference resource and should be updated as staff turnover, or as data sources shift. This information will also be used in the **Project Plan** tab and in Step 5 in the **IDEA Part B Data Submission Organizer**.
